            Due to the strict sterile and temperature controls required for the storage of lyophilized peptide research compounds, we do not accept returns or exchanges for items that have left our shipping chain custody.

            This policy is strictly enforced to guarantee the chemical integrity and sterility of compounds delivered to other laboratory clients.

Supporting chromatogram documentation must be provided for all quality claims.
